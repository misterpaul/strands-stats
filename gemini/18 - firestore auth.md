# Request

when I attempted to test locally, I got an error "Error: Unable to detect a Project Id in the current environment.¬†" What should the FIRESTORE_COLLECTION environment variable contain?

# Response

That's an excellent question, and it points to a missing piece in the local testing setup that the Google Cloud libraries require.

The error Unable to detect a Project Id happens because while you've authenticated your user account, the Firestore client library running on your Mac doesn't know which of your Google Cloud projects it should connect to.

The FIRESTORE_COLLECTION variable is unrelated to this error. It should simply contain the name you want to give your collection in the database, for example, gameResults or emailSubmissions.

## The Solution
The solution is to explicitly tell the client library which project to use by setting another environment variable: GCLOUD_PROJECT.

I have updated the Local Testing Guide to include this necessary change. The key update is in Step 5, where you now need to provide your Project ID when you run the local server.

# Updated Local Testing Guide

## How Local Testing Works

Your function is triggered by an event from Google Cloud Storage. To test this locally, we will:

Run your function's code on a local web server using the Functions Framework.

Create a "mock" event payload that looks exactly like the one GCS sends.

Upload a sample email file to your actual GCS bucket so the function has a real file to download and process.

Use a command-line tool like curl to send the mock event to your local server, triggering the function.

## Step 1: Finalize Your Project Setup

Make sure your project directory is set up correctly with the function code and its dependencies.

* `index.js`: Your main function code (from the Canvas).
* `package.json:` The file listing your dependencies.

If you haven't already, run `npm install` in your project directory to download the necessary packages.

```cd /path/to/your/my-email-function-js
npm install```

## Step 2: Create a Sample Email File
Create a new file in your project directory named `test-email.eml`. This file will contain the raw email content you want to test against.

File: test-email.eml

## Step 3: Upload the Test File to GCS

Your local function code still needs to connect to the real GCS to download the file.

Authenticate the gcloud CLI: If you haven't already, run `gcloud auth login`.

Upload the file: Use the gcloud command to copy your local test-email.eml to your source emails bucket.

```
# Replace your-emails-bucket with your actual bucket name
gcloud storage cp test-email.eml gs://your-emails-bucket/
```

## Step 4: Set Up Application Default Credentials

For the @google-cloud/storage and @google-cloud/firestore libraries to work from your local machine, they need to authenticate. The easiest way is with Application Default Credentials (ADC).

Run the following command in your terminal. It will open a browser window for you to log in and grant permissions.

`gcloud auth application-default login`

## Step 5: Run the Functions Framework

Now you can start the local server. When you run the command, you must prepend it with all the required environment variable definitions.

Replace the placeholder values with your actual resource names in the command below. You can find your Project ID on the main dashboard of your project in the Google Cloud Console.

```
GCLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id \
EMAILS_BUCKET=your-emails-bucket \
SUCCESS_BUCKET=your-success-bucket \
FAILURE_BUCKET=your-failure-bucket \
FIRESTORE_COLLECTION=your-firestore-collection \
npx @google-cloud/functions-framework --target=processIncomingEmailJs --signature-type=cloudevent
```

`GCLOUD_PROJECT`: (New) This tells the Firestore library which project to connect to.

The other environment variables are set just for this command's execution.

If successful, you will see output like this, and your terminal will hang, waiting for requests:

```
Serving function...
Function: processIncomingEmailJs
URL: http://localhost:8080/
```

## Step 6: Trigger Your Local Function
Open a new, separate terminal window (leave the server running in the first one). We will now send the mock event using curl.

Copy and paste the entire command below. Remember to replace your-emails-bucket with your actual bucket name.

```
curl localhost:8080 -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "ce-id: 12345" \
  -H "ce-specversion: 1.0" \
  -H "ce-type: google.cloud.storage.object.v1.finalized" \
  -H "ce-source: //storage.googleapis.com/projects/_/buckets/your-emails-bucket" \
  -H "ce-subject: objects/test-email.eml" \
  -d '{
        "bucket": "your-emails-bucket",
        "name": "test-email.eml"
      }'
```

Go back to your first terminal window (the one running the server). You should see all the console.log outputs from your function, including the Firestore write confirmation and the file move confirmation.
