# Request

how do I test the code in this cloud function locally on my Mac?

# Response

Of course. Testing locally before deploying is a crucial step for fast development and debugging. I can certainly provide a guide for that.

The standard way to test Google Cloud Functions on your local machine is by using the open-source Functions Framework. This tool runs a lightweight web server on your Mac that simulates the Google Cloud environment, allowing you to invoke your function just as it would be in the cloud.

Here is a step-by-step guide to get you set up for local testing.

**How Local Testing Works**

Your function is triggered by an event from Google Cloud Storage. To test this locally, we will:

1. Run your function's code on a local web server using the Functions Framework.
2. Create a "mock" event payload that looks exactly like the one GCS sends.
3. Upload a sample email file to your actual GCS bucket so the function has a real file to download and process.
4. Use a command-line tool like curl to send the mock event to your local server, triggering the function.

**Step 1: Finalize Your Project Setup**
Make sure your project directory is set up correctly with the function code and its dependencies.

* `index.js`: Your main function code (from the Canvas).
* `package.json`: The file listing your dependencies.

If you haven't already, run `npm install` in your project directory to download the necessary packages (@`google-cloud/functions-framework`, `@google-cloud/storage`, `mailparser`).

```
cd /path/to/your/my-email-function-js
npm install
```

**Step 2: Create a Sample Email File**
Create a new file in your project directory named test-email.eml. This file will contain the raw email content you want to test against.

File: `test-email.eml`

**Step 3: Upload the Test File to GCS**

Your local function code still needs to connect to the real GCS to download the file.

Authenticate the gcloud CLI: If you haven't already, run `gcloud auth login`.

Upload the file: Use the gcloud command to copy your local test-email.eml to your bucket.

```
# Replace BUCKET_NAME with your actual bucket name
gcloud storage cp test-email.eml gs://your-email-landing-zone-bucket/
```

**Step 4: Set Up Application Default Credentials**
For the @google-cloud/storage library to work from your local machine, it needs to authenticate. The easiest way is with Application Default Credentials (ADC).

Run the following command in your terminal. It will open a browser window for you to log in and grant permissions.

`gcloud auth application-default login`

**Step 5: Run the Functions Framework**
Now you can start the local server. In your terminal, from your project directory, run this command:

`npx @google-cloud/functions-framework --target=processIncomingEmailJs --signature-type=cloudevent`

* `--target`: The name of the function to run.
* `--signature-type`: Tells the framework to expect a CloudEvent payload, which is what GCS sends.

If successful, you will see output like this, and your terminal will hang, waiting for requests:

```
Serving function...
Function: processIncomingEmailJs
URL: http://localhost:8080/
```

**Step 6: Trigger Your Local Function**

Open a new, separate terminal window (leave the server running in the first one). We will now send the mock event using curl.

Copy and paste the entire command below. Remember to replace your-email-landing-zone-bucket with your actual bucket name.

```
curl localhost:8080 -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "ce-id: 12345" \
  -H "ce-specversion: 1.0" \
  -H "ce-type: google.cloud.storage.object.v1.finalized" \
  -H "ce-source: //storage.googleapis.com/projects/_/buckets/your-email-landing-zone-bucket" \
  -H "ce-subject: objects/test-email.eml" \
  -d '{
        "bucket": "your-email-landing-zone-bucket",
        "name": "test-email.eml"
      }'
```

What this command does:

It sends a POST request to your local server at `localhost:8080`.

The `-H` flags set the required CloudEvents headers.

The `-d` flag provides the JSON data payload, telling your function which bucket and name (file) triggered the event.

Go back to your first terminal window (the one running the server). You should see all the console.log outputs from your function, 
including the final `--- Extracted Game Data ---` JSON object. You have successfully tested your function locally!
