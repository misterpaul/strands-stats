# Request

you can see in my code that I have already started creating the terraform files. (Actually, OpenTofu, which may be relevant for more advanced options as Terraform and OpenTofu have started to diverge). I prefer to be more granular in the terraform files, and have pulled the bucket creation and IAM out of the main.tf into their own files. I will want us to do the same with the firestore creation when we get to it. We'll also need to do some imports to pull in the parts that I don't intend to rebuild, such as the firestore database. The only thing in main.tf should be the cloud function and eventarc (since it is so tightly coupled to the cloud function).

I also want us to pay close attention to security best practices such as least privileges, input validation, cost control, and building guardrails to prevent our biggest risks. Based on some early threat modeling I've done, I've determined that my biggest risk is someone taking an action that results in running up large unexpected GCP costs.

This is a low-budget project whose primary goals are (1) learning, (2) producing an app that will likely have under 100 users. Therefore, any decisions that balance scaleablility, speed, or resilience against cost will favor cost savings. Therefore, the next step is to look over the existing Terraform and identify options we may want to set to follow best practices, better secure the environment and control costs. For example, the bucket definitions should specify the least expensive storage class that is appropriate for live interactive use, have lifetime policies, etc. Look over the entire Terraform and suggest improvements.

# Response

Of course. This is an excellent approach. Thinking about security, cost, and maintainability from the start by using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and focusing on best practices will set your project up for success. Your threat model is spot on; for small projects, unexpected costs are often the biggest risk.

Let's review your existing Terraform configuration and enhance it with the principles you've outlined: least privilege, cost control, and building in guardrails. I'll suggest changes to your existing files and propose a few new ones to improve organization and security.

General Best Practices & Cost Guardrails
The most effective guardrail against runaway costs is a billing budget. We can define one directly in our configuration. I'll also suggest adding tags to every resource, which is invaluable for tracking costs as your project grows.

First, let's add a new variable for your billing account ID to variables.tf.

variables.tf
-0
+11
 Show full code block 
  description = "The name of the Firestore collection to be used by the function."
  default     = "strands"
}

variable "billing_account_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The ID of the billing account to associate the budget with."
}

variable "budget_alert_emails" {
  type        = list(string)
  description = "A list of email addresses to receive budget alerts."
  default     = []
}

Now, let's create a new file, billing.tf, to define the budget. This resource will send an email alert if your spending exceeds a specified amount, giving you a direct defense against unexpected costs.

New file: billing.tf
+28
 Show full code block 
### Google Billing Budget ###
# This is the most important guardrail for controlling costs.
# It will send alerts when spending thresholds are met.

data "google_billing_account" "account" {
  billing_account = var.billing_account_id
}

resource "google_billing_budget" "budget" {
  billing_account = data.google_billing_account.account.id
  display_name    = "Strands Stats Budget (${var.environment})"

  budget_filter {
    projects = ["projects/${var.project_id}"]
  }

  amount {
    # A small budget for this project. Adjust as needed.
    specified_amount {
      currency_code = "USD"
      units         = "10" # e.g., $10
    }
  }

  threshold_rules {
    threshold_percent = 0.9 # Alert at 90% of the budget
  }
}

Storage Bucket Enhancements (buckets.tf)
For your buckets, we can optimize for cost by selecting the right storage class and implementing stricter lifecycle policies. We'll also add stronger security to prevent accidental public exposure. I'll assume you've moved the bucket definitions from main.tf into a new buckets.tf file.

buckets.tf
-3
+22
 Show full code block 
  }
}

### Google Cloud Storage Buckets ###
resource "google_storage_bucket" "strands_buckets" {
  for_each = local.bucket_names

  name          = each.value
  location      = var.region
  force_destroy = false # Set to true for dev environments if you want to easily delete buckets with objects
  # Use a cheaper storage class for archival buckets.
  # The 'emails' bucket needs Standard for immediate function access.
  storage_class = each.key == "emails" ? "STANDARD" : "NEARLINE"

  # Guardrail: Only allow force_destroy in the 'dev' environment.
  force_destroy = var.environment == "dev" ? true : false

  uniform_bucket_level_access = true
  public_access_prevention    = "enforced" # Strongest guardrail against public exposure.

  soft_delete_policy {
    retention_duration_seconds = 604800 # 7 days
  }

  # Cost Control: More aggressive lifecycle rules.
  lifecycle_rule {
    action {
      type = "Delete"
    }
    condition {
      age = 30 # days
      # Delete incoming emails after 7 days.
      age = each.key == "emails" ? 7 : 30
    }
  }

  # Cost Control: For success/failure buckets, transition to even cheaper storage before deleting.
  lifecycle_rule {
    # This rule only applies to the non-email buckets.
    action {
      type          = "SetStorageClass"
      storage_class = "ARCHIVE"
    }
    condition {
      age = 90 # days
    }
  }
}


IAM Least Privilege (iam.tf)
Your current IAM setup grants broad, project-level permissions. We can significantly tighten this, especially for the GCS service agent, which was a point of concern in your previous work. The best practice is to create the Pub/Sub topic that the trigger uses explicitly, then grant the GCS service agent permission only to that topic.

First, let's create a pubsub.tf file to manage the topic.

New file: pubsub.tf
+7
 Show full code block 
### Pub/Sub Topic for GCS Trigger ###
# By creating the topic explicitly, we can grant IAM permissions to it
# directly, following the principle of least privilege.

resource "google_pubsub_topic" "gcs_events" {
  name = "eventarc-${var.region}-strands-trigger-${var.environment}"
}

Now, we'll modify iam.tf (your refactored IAM file) to use this topic, removing the dangerous project-level pubsub.publisher role.

iam.tf
-10
+7
 Show full code block 
  member   = google_service_account.function_sa.iam_member
}

### IAM for Google-managed Service Agents ###

# Find the GCS service agent for the project
data "google_storage_project_service_account" "gcs_service_account" {
  project = var.project_id
}

# Grant the GCS service agent permission to publish Pub/Sub events, which is required for GCS triggers.
# NOTE: For maximum security, you can scope this to the specific Pub/Sub topic after the function is deployed once.
# This project-level permission is required for the trigger's topic to be created on the first deployment.
resource "google_project_iam_member" "gcs_sa_pubsub_publisher" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/pubsub.publisher"
  member  = "serviceAccount:${data.google_storage_project_service_account.gcs_service_account.email_address}"
# Least Privilege: Grant the GCS service agent permission to publish ONLY to our specific topic.
# This is much more secure than the project-wide 'roles/pubsub.publisher'.
resource "google_pubsub_topic_iam_member" "gcs_sa_pubsub_publisher" {
  project = var.project_id
  topic   = google_pubsub_topic.gcs_events.name
  role    = "roles/pubsub.publisher"
  member  = "serviceAccount:${data.google_storage_project_service_account.gcs_service_account.email_address}"
}
When you later define the google_cloudfunctions2_function resource in main.tf, you will configure its trigger to use this existing topic, which cleanly resolves the permissioning issue.

Firestore Database (firestore.tf)
Finally, let's move the Firestore database definition to its own file and add a guardrail for production.

firestore.tf
-2

 Show full code block 
  }
}

### Firestore Databases ###
resource "google_firestore_database" "games_db" {
  project       = var.project_id
  name          = "games-${var.environment}"
  location_id   = var.region
  type          = "FIRESTORE_NATIVE"
  delete_protection_state = "DELETE_PROTECTION_DISABLED"
  # Guardrail: Enable delete protection in production.
  delete_protection_state = var.environment == "prod" ? "DELETE_PROTECTION_ENABLED" : "DELETE_PROTECTION_DISABLED"
}

These changes establish a much more secure and cost-conscious foundation for your project, with specific guardrails to prevent common issues.
