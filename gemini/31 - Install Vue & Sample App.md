Ok. What is the next logical step? Should we set up App Engine or start writing code and run it locally?

# Response

That's the perfect question to ask at this stage. Given that your primary goal is to build the user-facing application, the most logical and efficient next step is to start writing code and run it locally.

Here's why this approach is better:

* Fast Feedback Loop: Modern tools like Vite provide a local development server with hot-reloading. This means you can see your code changes reflected in the browser almost instantly, which is much faster than deploying to App Engine or Firebase Hosting every time you make a change.
* Focus on the User Experience: You can build and perfect the entire "Hello Guest" -> "Sign In" -> "Hello " flow on your machine without being distracted by deployment configurations.
* Local Testing is Ready: You've already configured your OAuth Client ID to work with localhost, so you have everything you need to build and test the authentication logic locally.
* Once you have a working application on your Mac, setting up the deployment infrastructure with OpenTofu will be a more straightforward task.

## Next Step: Create the Vue.js Application
Let's create the skeleton for your web application using Vite, the standard build tool for modern Vue.js projects.

1. Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal (e.g., /Users/paul/Code/gh/strands-stats2/).
2. Run the Vite scaffolding command. This will launch an interactive setup process.
  `npm create vue@latest`
3. Answer the prompts: Vite will ask you a series of questions to configure your project. I recommend the following choices for a solid start:
  * Project name: webapp (or frontend)
  * Add TypeScript? Yes (It's a best practice for building robust applications).
  * Add JSX Support? No
  * Add Vue Router for Single-Page App development? Yes (You will need this for different pages like "home", "dashboard", etc.).
  * Add Pinia for state management? Yes (Excellent for managing user authentication state across your app).
  * Add Vitest for Unit Testing? Yes
  * Add an End-to-End Testing Solution? No (You can add this later).
  * Add ESLint for code quality? Yes
  * Add Prettier for code formatting? Yes
  
After you answer the questions, Vite will create a new webapp directory with a complete, ready-to-run Vue.js project inside. The next step will be to cd into that new directory, install the dependencies, and start the local development server.
