# Request

that's a great start. I moved both files to threat_modeling/gemini. We'll come back to it later.

Back to coding. npm create vue@latest is asking if we want to skip all example code and start with a blank Vue project. Do you agree I should say "yes"?

# Response

That's a great question, and it's a key decision point in the scaffolding process.

For this project, I would actually recommend against skipping the example code. You should answer "No" to the prompt asking if you want to skip it.

Hereâ€™s why:

1. Excellent Learning Tool: Since one of your primary goals is learning, the example code is invaluable. It provides a high-quality, working demonstration of how Vue, TypeScript, Vue Router, and Pinia are all wired together correctly.
2. Provides a Pattern: You'll immediately have a reference for how to structure components, define routes in router/index.ts, and create a state management module in stores/counter.ts. It's much easier to adapt a working pattern than to create one from a blank slate.
3. Minimal Cleanup: The effort required to delete the example components and views later is very small, and the benefit of having a working reference to inspect first is significant.
Once the project is created, the next steps will be to cd into the new webapp directory, run npm install to get the dependencies, and then npm run dev to see the example application running in your browser. From there, we can start modifying it to build your authentication flow.

# Request

Ok. Vue is installed and the sample app is running. Shall we start coding the app and test it locally on my Mac.  A reminder, here is what we plan on doing in this first iteration:

1. Shows a "Hello Guest" screen when an unauthenticated user connects, and provides a link to the Google Identity authentication screen (or embeds it within the page)
2. Shows a "Hello <username>" screen once the user is authenticated.

# Response

Excellent. With the sample app running, you have a solid foundation. Let's start coding the authentication flow. Your plan is perfect: we'll build the "Hello Guest" and "Hello " views and test them entirely on your local machine.

To achieve this, we'll use a popular library to simplify Google Sign-In for Vue and Pinia to manage the user's login state.

Step 1: Install Dependencies
First, we need to add two small libraries to your webapp project:

vue3-google-login: A lightweight wrapper that makes adding a Google Sign-In button and handling the response incredibly simple.
jwt-decode: A utility to decode the credential token that Google sends back, which contains the user's profile information.
Navigate to your webapp directory in the terminal and run:

bash
cd /Users/paul/Code/gh/strands-stats2/webapp
npm install vue3-google-login jwt-decode
Step 2: Configure Your Client ID
Create a new file named .env.local in the root of your webapp directory. This file is the standard, secure way to store environment variables for local development. Vite will automatically load it, and it's ignored by Git by default.

New file: .env.local
+1
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_HERE"

Action: Replace YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_HERE with the actual Client ID you created in the Google Cloud Console.

Step 3: Initialize the Google Login Plugin
Now, let's tell your Vue app to use the vue3-google-login plugin with the Client ID you just configured.

import './assets/main.css'

import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createPinia } from 'pinia'
import vue3GoogleLogin from 'vue3-google-login'

import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(createPinia())
app.use(router)

app.use(vue3GoogleLogin, {
  clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
})

app.mount('#app')

Step 4: Create an Authentication Store
We'll use Pinia to create a central "store" to manage the user's authentication state. This makes it easy for any component in your app to know if a user is logged in and who they are.

First, delete the example counter store: rm webapp/src/stores/counter.ts

Now, create a new auth.ts store:

New file: auth.ts
+25
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export interface UserProfile {
  name: string
  email: string
  picture: string
}

export const useAuthStore = defineStore('auth', () => {
  const isLoggedIn = ref(false)
  const userProfile = ref<UserProfile | null>(null)

  function login(profile: UserProfile) {
    userProfile.value = profile
    isLoggedIn.value = true
  }

  function logout() {
    userProfile.value = null
    isLoggedIn.value = false
  }

  return { isLoggedIn, userProfile, login, logout }
})

Step 5: Build the User Interface
Now we'll replace the content of HomeView.vue with our login/logout logic. This component will use the auth store to conditionally show either the guest view or the authenticated view.

<script setup lang="ts">
import TheWelcome from '../components/TheWelcome.vue'
</script>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { GoogleLogin, type CredentialResponse } from 'vue3-google-login'
import { decodeCredential } from 'vue3-google-login'
import { useAuthStore, type UserProfile } from '@/stores/auth'

const authStore = useAuthStore()

const handleLoginSuccess = (response: CredentialResponse) => {
  const userData = decodeCredential(response.credential) as UserProfile
  console.log('Logged in user:', userData)
  authStore.login(userData)
}

const handleLoginError = () => {
  console.error('Login failed')
}

const handleLogout = () => {
  authStore.logout()
}
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <TheWelcome />
  </main>
  <div>
    <div v-if="!authStore.isLoggedIn" class="login-container">
      <h1>Hello, Guest!</h1>
      <p>Please sign in to view your stats.</p>
      <GoogleLogin :callback="handleLoginSuccess" :error-callback="handleLoginError" />
    </div>
    <div v-else class="welcome-container">
      <img :src="authStore.userProfile?.picture" alt="User profile picture" class="profile-pic" />
      <h1>Hello, {{ authStore.userProfile?.name }}</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Strands Stats!</p>
      <button @click="handleLogout">Logout</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.login-container, .welcome-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 2rem;
}
.profile-pic {
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 60px;
  height: 60px;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
</style>

Step 6: Clean Up the Project
Finally, let's remove the remaining boilerplate code from the sample app to keep our project clean.

Clean up the router:

index.ts
      path: '/',
      name: 'home',
      component: HomeView
plaintext
   },
plaintext
   {
plaintext
     path: '/about',
plaintext
     name: 'about',
plaintext
     // route level code-splitting
plaintext
     // this generates a separate chunk (About.[hash].js) for this route
plaintext
     // which is lazy-loaded when the route is visited.
plaintext
     component: () => import('../views/AboutView.vue')
   }
 ]
})

plaintext

Simplify the main App.vue component:

<script setup lang="ts">
import { RouterLink, RouterView } from 'vue-router'
import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld.vue'
import { RouterView } from 'vue-router'

    <img alt="Vue logo" class="logo" src="@/assets/logo.svg" width="125" height="125" />

    <div class="wrapper">
      <HelloWorld msg="You did it!" />

      <nav>
        <RouterLink to="/">Home</RouterLink>
        <RouterLink to="/about">About</RouterLink>
      </nav>
plaintext
 <main>
plaintext
   <RouterView />
plaintext
 </main>
main {
plaintext
 padding: 1rem;
}
plaintext
```
Delete unused files:
rm webapp/src/views/AboutView.vue
rm -rf webapp/src/components/* (delete all files in the components directory)
Run the App
You're all set! Go to your terminal in the webapp directory and run the local development server:

bash
npm run dev
Open your browser to http://localhost:5173. You should see the "Hello, Guest!" screen with a "Sign in with Google" button. Click it, sign in, and you should see the "Hello, " screen.

# Request

1. FYI, I named the project (and thus the folder) games-stats-gui rather than webapp. Please update your internal references so you have the correct path.

2. What is the risk of storing the Google Client ID in Github? Should I add .env.local to my .gitignore file? Or is it a public key?

3. I assume the new auth.ts store goes in src/stores

4. Cleaning up the router looks like there were no changes. The way you presented it was very confusing too. Hopefully now that you have the correct path you can revisit that one.

5. The Changes to App.vue also were very confusing. Again, lets revisit that one.

6. I did remove AboutView.vue and components/*

After we resolve the points here I;ll try to run it

# Response 

Excellent questions. Let's clarify these points to get your local environment running smoothly. You've raised some very important details.

## 1. Project Path (games-stats-gui)
Thank you for the correction. I have updated my internal references and will use /Users/paul/Code/gh/strands-stats2/games-stats-gui/ as the path for the Vue application going forward.

## 2. Google Client ID Security
This is a crucial security question.

* Is it a public key? Yes, the OAuth 2.0 Client ID is considered public information. It is designed to be embedded in the client-side JavaScript of your web application. It cannot be used on its own to do anything malicious.
* What is the risk? The security comes from the Authorized JavaScript origins you configured in the Google Cloud Console. Only web pages served from those origins (e.g., http://localhost:5173 and eventually your production URL) are allowed to use that Client ID to initiate a sign-in flow. If someone copied your Client ID and tried to use it on their own malicious website, Google's servers would reject the request.
* Should .env.local be in .gitignore? Yes, absolutely. Your .gitignore file already includes the line .env.local, which is perfect. While the Client ID itself is public, it is a strong best practice to keep all environment-specific configurations out of version control. This prevents accidental leakage of future, more sensitive keys (like API keys) and allows each developer (and your production environment) to use different configurations.

## 3. auth.ts Store Location

You are correct. The new auth.ts file should be created in /Users/paul/Code/gh/strands-stats2/games-stats-gui/src/stores/.

(diff not shown)

## 4. Router Cleanup (router/index.ts)

My apologies for the confusing presentation. You are correct that the goal is to remove the /about route that was part of the boilerplate. Here is a clear diff to make that change.

(diff not shown)

## 5. Main App Component Cleanup (App.vue)
Again, my apologies for the confusion. The goal here is to strip out all the boilerplate header, logo, and navigation from the main App.vue component, leaving only a simple container for our views.

Here is the corrected diff for /Users/paul/Code/gh/strands-stats2/games-stats-gui/src/App.vue:

(diff now shown)

With these clarifications and corrected code changes, you should now have a clean project structure ready for you to run `npm run dev` and test the authentication flow.

# Request

Ok, it runs. But, I don't see a way to authenticate, and we have 41 errors in the Browser's console:

(errors not shown)

# Response

You've run into a very common issue when working with environment variables in modern JavaScript frameworks. The good news is that the console logs point us directly to the solution.

While there are many "noisy" errors in that log that appear to be from a browser extension (like a password manager), the critical error is this one:

Uncaught (in promise) Error: Prop client id required since plugin is not initialized with a client id

This error means that when the vue3-google-login plugin tried to initialize, the value for clientId was undefined. This happens because the Vite development server only reads .env files (like your .env.local) when it first starts up.

If you created or modified the .env.local file while the server was already running, it won't see the VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID variable.

The Solution: Restart the Dev Server
Go to the terminal where npm run dev is running.
Stop the server by pressing Ctrl+C.
Restart the server by running npm run dev again.
This will force Vite to load your .env.local file, and the Google Sign-In button should now appear and function correctly.

Code Quality Improvement: Persisting Login State
Once you have the login working, you'll notice that if you refresh the page after logging in, you'll be logged out again. This is because the user's state is only stored in memory.

A best practice is to persist the login state in the browser's sessionStorage. This will keep the user logged in across page reloads during their session.

Here is an update to your auth.ts store that implements this improvement. It checks sessionStorage when the app loads and saves the user's profile upon successful login.

# IT WORKS!
