# Request

Seems to work great. Next, lets better handle if certain fields are missing. If any of the following are empty, throw a relevant error for missing data:

* parsedEmail.from
* parsedEmail.to
* gameData.sender
* gameData.gameNumber
* gameData.gameTitle
* gameData.results

# Response

Of course. Adding validation to ensure all required data is present is an excellent way to make the function more robust.

I have updated the Cloud Function code to include the error handling you requested for all specified fields.

The new logic will now check each of the required fields after parsing. If any of them are missing (null), it will throw a specific error, which will stop the processing of that email and log the issue clearly. This prevents incomplete data from being processed downstream.
