# Request

lets put this whole deployment process into a terraform script.

# Response

Of course. Automating the entire deployment with Terraform is the standard for creating reproducible, production-grade infrastructure. It's a much more robust approach than running manual gcloud commands.

I will provide you with a complete set of Terraform configuration files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf) that will provision all the necessary resources and permissions, as well as a README.md file explaining how to use them.

Project Structure
For this to work, you will need to organize your files as follows:

/terraform-deployment
  |- main.tf
  |- variables.tf
  |- outputs.tf
  |- README.md
  /source
    |- index.js
    |- package.json
Place the index.js and package.json files from the Canvas into the /source subdirectory.
