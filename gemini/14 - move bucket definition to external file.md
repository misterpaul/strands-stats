# Request

Can we move the BUCKET_NAME definition to outside the index.js? Perhaps a config map or other external configuration file.

# Response

Yes, moving the `BUCKET_NAME` out of the code is an excellent idea and a security best practice. The standard and recommended way to handle external configuration in Google Cloud Functions is by using environment variables.

Using environment variables is better than a separate config file because:

* **Security**: It keeps sensitive data like bucket names, API keys, or project IDs out of your source code (and out of source control like Git).
* **Flexibility**: You can deploy the same code to different environments (development, staging, production) just by changing the environment variables at deployment time, without a single code change.
* **Best Practice**: It follows the [12-Factor App methodology](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpsd://12factor.net/config&authuser=1&sei=LltpaNzgAYKu5NoPqNi7qAo), a widely accepted set of principles for building modern, scalable applications.

I have updated the three relevant documents to reflect this change.

1. Function Code Update
The index.js file is now updated to read `BUCKET_NAME` from the environment. I also added a check to ensure the function fails quickly if the variable isn't set.

2. Deployment Instructions Update
The deployment command has been updated to use the `--set-env-vars` flag to securely provide the bucket name to the function.

3. Local Testing Guide Update
The local testing guide is updated to show how to provide the environment variable on your Mac.
