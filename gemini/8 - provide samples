provided 2 files for it to use in analysis

# Request:

here is a sample email that we will parse, with many headers removed.

(uploaded sample-email.text)

# Response

Thank you for providing the sample email. I have analyzed its content.

The current JavaScript Cloud Function (email_processor_function_js) is already perfectly equipped to handle this email format without any changes.

Here's how it will be parsed:

The raw email content you provided will be streamed from the GCS file into the mailparser library.

mailparser will automatically detect that the body is encoded using "quoted-printable" (the =E2... and =F0... sequences) and decode it to standard UTF-8 text. The emojis and smart quotes will be handled correctly.

The parsedEmail object will be populated with the decoded data.

When your function runs with this email, you should expect to see the following in your Cloud Function logs:

```
--- Parsed Email ---
  From: Paul Faulstich <paul@waltzingcat.com>
  To: games@sennovation.com
  Subject: Strands
--- Email Body (Plain Text) ---
Strands #482
“... not included”
🟧🔵🔵🔵
🔵🔵

Sent from my mobile device. Pardon teh typos.
```


No modifications to the existing code are necessary to parse this sample.

# Reuest #2

here is the same sample file, with the data I want to extract replaced with field names between double-exclamation-points. For example, the number 482 is replaced here with !!gameNumber!! so the script should set gameNumber to 482 when it parses.

Got it. This is a classic "parsing unstructured text" problem, and it's a perfect use case for a Cloud Function. You want to extract specific, structured data from the email body.

I will modify the JavaScript Cloud Function to use regular expressions to find and extract the gameNumber, gameTitle, and the emoji results from the email body after it has been parsed.

I have updated the code in the immersive document on the right.

Here are the key changes I've made:

Regular Expressions: I've added two regular expressions to specifically find the lines containing the game number and the game title.

Data Extraction: The code now uses these expressions to pull out the data.

Results Block Parsing: I've added logic to isolate the block of text containing the emoji grid by identifying the lines that come before and after it.

Structured Logging: The function now logs a clean JSON object containing the extracted data (sender, game, gameNumber, gameTitle, and results), which you could easily save to a database like Firestore.

The updated function can now turn that plain text email into structured, usable data.
