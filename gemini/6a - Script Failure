I have confirmed that the label exactly matches GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL

If this error is due to GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL not being found, then this code does not make sense; it will never get to the check for if the processingLabel exists.

```
const processingLabel = Gmail.Users.Labels.get('me', GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL);
if (!processingLabel) {
  console.error(`Error: Processing label "${GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL}" not found. Please create it in Gmail.`);
  return;
}
```

# Response

You are absolutely right. My apologies, that is an excellent point and a flaw in the original logic. You are correct that if Gmail.Users.Labels.get() fails to find the label, it throws an exception immediately, and the if (!processingLabel) check is never reached.

The code needs to be more defensive and anticipate that the API call itself can fail. I've corrected the script to wrap the label checks in try...catch blocks. This is the proper way to handle this error.

I have updated the script below. Please replace the code in your Apps Script project with this revised version.

I also noticed that I was using Gmail.Users.Labels.get which is part of the advanced "Gmail API" service, but the simpler GmailApp.getUserLabelByName() works just as well and is built-in, so I have switched to that for clarity. The logic is now more robust.

Since you've confirmed the label name matches exactly, running this updated code should give a more precise error if there's still an underlying issue, such as a problem with permissions.
