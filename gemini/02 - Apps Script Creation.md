# Request

if the email is hosted by Google Workspace, what is the simplest way to trigger the cloud function?

# Response

That's an excellent question. When your email is hosted on Google Workspace, you can create a much more integrated pipeline that doesn't require a third-party service like SendGrid or Mailgun.

The simplest and most direct "Google-native" method is to use Google Apps Script as the bridge between your Gmail inbox and Cloud Storage.

The overall architecture you have in the document remains the recommended pattern, but we just swap out the "Email Forwarding Service" with an Apps Script.

The new flow looks like this:

Email Received: An email arrives in your Google Workspace Gmail account.

Google Apps Script Trigger: A script, running on a time-based trigger (e.g., every minute), scans your inbox for new messages (e.g., by looking for unread messages or a specific label).

Apps Script Execution: For each new email it finds, the script gets the full, raw email content and uploads it as a file to your Cloud Storage bucket. It then marks the email as processed (e.g., by marking it as read or adding a label like "processed").

Cloud Storage & Cloud Function: The rest of the flow is identical to what I described before. The new file in Cloud Storage triggers your Gen 2 Cloud Function, which then parses the email content.

This approach is simpler in a Workspace context because it keeps everything within the Google Cloud ecosystem, making authentication and setup more straightforward.

Here is the Apps Script code you would use for this.

## Apps Script Code

```
// Google Apps Script Code (Code.gs)

// --- CONFIGURATION ---
// 1. The name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket you created.
const GCS_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-email-landing-zone-bucket'; 

// 2. The Gmail label to look for. Emails with this label will be processed.
//    Create this label in your Gmail settings. This is safer than using 'is:unread'.
//    For example: 'process-for-cloud-function'
const GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL = 'process-for-cloud-function';

// 3. The Gmail label to apply after an email has been successfully processed.
//    Create this label in your Gmail settings.
const GMAIL_PROCESSED_LABEL = 'processed-by-script';


/**
 * @description This is the main function to be run by a time-based trigger.
 * It searches for emails with the specified label, saves them to GCS,
 * and then updates their labels.
 */
function processNewEmails() {
  const processingLabel = Gmail.Users.Labels.get('me', GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL);
  if (!processingLabel) {
    console.error(`Error: Processing label "${GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL}" not found. Please create it in Gmail.`);
    return;
  }

  const processedLabel = Gmail.Users.Labels.get('me', GMAIL_PROCESSED_LABEL);
  if (!processedLabel) {
    console.error(`Error: Processed label "${GMAIL_PROCESSED_LABEL}" not found. Please create it in Gmail.`);
    return;
  }
  
  // Search for threads with the processing label but not the processed label
  const query = `label:${GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL} -label:${GMAIL_PROCESSED_LABEL}`;
  const threads = GmailApp.search(query);

  if (threads.length === 0) {
    console.log("No new emails to process.");
    return;
  }

  console.log(`Found ${threads.length} new email thread(s) to process.`);

  // Get an OAuth2 token to authorize the GCS request
  const accessToken = ScriptApp.getOAuthToken();

  threads.forEach(thread => {
    const messages = thread.getMessages();
    messages.forEach(message => {
      try {
        // Double-check this specific message hasn't been processed
        if (message.getThread().getLabels().some(label => label.getName() === GMAIL_PROCESSED_LABEL)) {
            return; // Skip if already processed
        }

        console.log(`Processing message: "${message.getSubject()}" (ID: ${message.getId()})`);

        // Get the raw RFC 822 formatted email content
        const rawContent = message.getRawContent();

        // Create a unique file name for the object in GCS
        const fileName = `${message.getDate().toISOString()}_${message.getId()}.eml`;

        // Upload the file to Google Cloud Storage
        uploadToGCS(fileName, rawContent, accessToken);

        // Mark as processed by removing the old label and adding the new one
        thread.removeLabel(GmailApp.getUserLabelByName(GMAIL_PROCESSING_LABEL));
        thread.addLabel(GmailApp.getUserLabelByName(GMAIL_PROCESSED_LABEL));
        
        console.log(`Successfully processed and moved ${fileName} to GCS.`);

      } catch (e) {
        console.error(`Failed to process message ID ${message.getId()}. Error: ${e.toString()}`);
        // Consider applying an "error" label here
      }
    });
  });
}

/**
 * @description Uploads a file to Google Cloud Storage using the REST API.
 * @param {string} fileName The name of the file to create in GCS.
 * @param {string} fileContent The content of the file.
 * @param {string} accessToken The OAuth2 token for authorization.
 */
function uploadToGCS(fileName, fileContent, accessToken) {
  const url = `https://storage.googleapis.com/upload/storage/v1/b/${GCS_BUCKET_NAME}/o?uploadType=media&name=${encodeURIComponent(fileName)}`;
  
  const headers = {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'message/rfc822' // Standard MIME type for email files
  };

  const options = {
    method: 'post',
    headers: headers,
    payload: fileContent,
    muteHttpExceptions: true // Prevents script from stopping on error, lets us log it
  };

  const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options);
  const responseCode = response.getResponseCode();
  const responseBody = response.getContentText();

  if (responseCode >= 200 && responseCode < 300) {
    console.log(`GCS Upload Success: ${responseBody}`);
  } else {
    throw new Error(`GCS Upload Failed. Response Code: ${responseCode}. Body: ${responseBody}`);
  }
}

/**
 * HOW TO SET THIS UP:
 * 1. Go to script.google.com and create a new project.
 * 2. Paste this entire code into the `Code.gs` file.
 * 3. Update the CONFIGURATION variables at the top.
 * 4. In Gmail, create the two labels you defined (e.g., 'process-for-cloud-function' and 'processed-by-script').
 * 5. In your Gmail settings, create a filter that applies the 'process-for-cloud-function' label to incoming mail you want to process.
 * 6. In the Apps Script Editor, go to "Services" (+ icon) and add the "Gmail API".
 * 7. Go to "Project Settings" (gear icon) and check "Show 'appsscript.json' manifest file in editor".
 * 8. Edit the `appsscript.json` file to add the required Cloud Platform scope:
 * "oauthScopes": [
 * "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly",
 * "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify",
 * "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request",
 * "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" <--- ADD THIS LINE
 * ]
 * 9. Go to "Triggers" (clock icon) in the left menu.
 * 10. Click "Add Trigger", choose `processNewEmails` to run, select "Time-driven" as the event source, 
 * and set it to run on a "Minutes timer" (e.g., every 1, 5, or 10 minutes).
 * 11. Save the trigger. It will ask you to authorize the script. Follow the prompts.
