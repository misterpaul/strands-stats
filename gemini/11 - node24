# Request

is there anything in index.js that won't work with Node 24?

# Response

That's a great forward-looking question.

Based on the code in index.js, the answer is yes, the code itself is fully compatible and should run without any issues on Node.js 24.

Here's why:

Standard Features: The code uses modern but very standard JavaScript features (like async/await, optional chaining ?., and Unicode property escapes \p{Emoji} in regex) that are well-established parts of the language and are not at risk of being deprecated or changed.

No Deprecated APIs: It doesn't rely on any old or experimental Node.js APIs that are scheduled for removal.

Stable Dependencies: The libraries used (@google-cloud/storage, mailparser, and the Functions Framework itself) are mature and well-maintained. They are designed to work across all active and future LTS (Long-Term Support) versions of Node.js.

The only "catch" is not with your code, but with the Google Cloud Functions environment itself. As of now, Node 20 is the latest LTS runtime available. Node 24 won't be available as a runtime option until after it is officially released (scheduled for April 2025) and subsequently added to the list of supported runtimes by the Cloud Functions team.

So, while you can't deploy to Node 24 today, you can be confident that your code is future-proof and will not require changes to run on that version when it becomes available.

please re-respond given that we are now in July 2025

# Response

You're right to check in on this, given that we're now in July 2025.

The good news is that the local testing process outlined in the guide on your screen is stable, and the steps remain exactly the same. The Functions Framework is designed to work with the version of Node.js you have installed on your Mac, so the guide itself doesn't need any changes.

However, your question touches on the bigger context from our last conversation. As of July 2025:

Node.js 24 is the new LTS (Long-Term Support) version and is now available as a runtime in Google Cloud Functions.

Your index.js code is fully compatible with it.

Therefore, while the local testing steps are unchanged, you should now target nodejs24 when you deploy your function to get the best performance and longest support window.

The deployment instructions are in a separate document. Would you like me to update the deployment command in the "Deployment Instructions (JavaScript/Node.js)" artifact to use nodejs24?

# Request

Yes

# Response

1. Project Structure
Organize your files in a simple directory. The main file should be named index.js.

```
/my-email-function-js
  |- index.js
  |- package.json
```

2. package.json File
This file manages your project's dependencies, similar to requirements.txt in Python. Create a file named package.json with the following content:

```
{
  "name": "email-processor-function",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Processes emails from a GCS bucket.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "@google-cloud/functions-framework": "^3.0.0",
    "@google-cloud/storage": "^7.0.0",
    "mailparser": "^3.6.0"
  }
}
```

After creating this file, navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run npm install to download the dependencies.

3. Deploy the Cloud Function
Open your terminal, navigate to the /my-email-function-js directory, and run the following command. Make sure to replace your-gcp-region and your-email-landing-zone-bucket with your specific values.

```
gcloud functions deploy processIncomingEmailJs \
  --gen2 \
  --runtime=nodejs24 \
  --region=your-gcp-region \
  --source=. \
  --entry-point=processIncomingEmailJs \
  --trigger-event-filters="type=google.cloud.storage.object.v1.finalized" \
  --trigger-event-filters="bucket=your-email-landing-zone-bucket"
```

Key Command Differences:

`--runtime`: Is now nodejs24 to use the latest Long-Term Support version.

`--entry-point`: Is the name of the function we registered with the functions framework (`processIncomingEmailJs`).

The function name `processIncomingEmailJs` is also used as the deployment name.

The rest of the architecture, including the use of Apps Script to get emails into the bucket, remains exactly the same.
