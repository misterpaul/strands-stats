# Assets Directory

This directory is the standard location for static assets that are processed by the build tool (Vite).

## Contents

*   **CSS Files:** Global stylesheets like `main.css` that define the base styles for the application.
*   **Images:** SVGs, PNGs, or JPEGs like logos or icons that are used within your Vue components.
*   **Fonts:** Custom font files you might want to include in your project.
